    "summary": "With over 18 years of experience as a full-stack developer and DevOps engineer, I have worked across industries from real estate and education to startups and large enterprises. Currently CTO and co-founder of Apiable, I lead the technical team, oversee the architecture, and implement AWS-based solutions. Specialized in React, NodeJS, Java/Kotlin, AI MCP, Python FastAPI, AWS, and CI/CD. I thrive in lean, fast-paced environments with a focus on high-quality delivery. I'm looking for remote freelance opportunities where I can contribute 40-60% (negotiable) of my time in full-stack and DevOps roles. Recently turned 42, still learning new things every day, like the fact that cats can't taste sweetness.",
