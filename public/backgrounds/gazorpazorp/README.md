# Gazorpazorp Theme Design References

This directory is for storing design references for the Gazorpazorp theme. If you have design ideas for how the theme should look, you can share them in several ways:

## How to Share Your Design Ideas

### Option 1: Upload Image Files

You can upload image files (PNG, JPG, SVG) to this directory. These images will be accessible in the application and can be referenced when implementing the theme.

Example file formats:
- `design-mockup.png`
- `color-scheme.jpg`
- `layout-idea.svg`

### Option 2: Share Figma Design

Create your design in Figma and share the link. Make sure your Figma design is set to "Anyone with the link can view".

The link should look like: `https://www.figma.com/file/abcdef123456/Design`

You can then share this link with the development team, who can embed it in the application using the `DesignReference` component.

### Option 3: Share Canva Design

Create your design in Canva and share the link. Make sure your Canva design is set to "Public".

The link should look like: `https://www.canva.com/design/ABC123/view`

### Option 4: Share PDF

You can also upload a PDF file with your design to this directory or provide a link to an externally hosted PDF.

## Design Guidelines

When creating your design for the Gazorpazorp theme, consider the following:

1. **Color Scheme**: The current theme uses green (#97ce4c) and orange (#ff9800) as primary colors, with dark brown (#44281d) for text.

2. **Style**: The theme is inspired by Rick & Morty, so consider the cartoon's visual style, including:
   - Vibrant colors
   - Slightly irregular shapes
   - Sci-fi elements
   - Portal/dimension-hopping motifs

3. **Layout**: The design should work for a resume/CV format, with clear sections for:
   - Personal information
   - Work experience
   - Education
   - Skills
   - Projects
   - Languages
   - Certificates

4. **Responsiveness**: Consider how the design will look on different screen sizes, including when printed.

## Implementation

Once you've shared your design, the development team can implement it in the Gazorpazorp theme. The design can influence colors, layout, typography, and other visual elements of the theme.
